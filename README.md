### Web Technologies Used

React : I consider this because it is easy to implement compared to Next.js , create UI and it offer benefits of resuable amd attribute based archecture.

PokeAPI : This api give free pokemon complete information and some staticial data about the pokemon.

CSS and HTML : Both used to building web pages and one for creating web page and second one for styling the web page.

The Axios : It is used to made requests to application programm interface(API).



### Install and Run process commands
 First Step :(open terminal and Clone the repository) :
 
          git clone https://github.com/VePhaneendra/Deelsolv.git

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
